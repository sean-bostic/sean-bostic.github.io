    <h1>An Early Beginning in Video Games?</h1> <br>

    <p>I always enjoy problem solving and using critical thinking to solve complex problems. I have had the most
        fun
        doing
        this with the almost limitless power of software. Ever since I was a kid, I always enjoyed working with
        computers. I
        started out with hardware believe it or not and eventually found a career in software development. I built
        my
        first
        computer from scratch when I was about ten which really was just a shiny new computer case with salvaged
        parts
        from
        various other machines that I had disassembled. My first <strong>TRUE</strong> computer build was when I
        was
        about
        12. I quickly began playing various PC games especially the legendary FPS games such as Quake,
        Counterstrike,
        and
        Medal of Honor. These games had increasing specifications for more powerful hardware and that led me to
        learn
        more
        about building computers.</p> <br>

    <p>Not only did video games get me into building computers, they ultimately introduced me to code and were the
        main
        driving force for me to get into software development. One of my favorite things about video games was the
        ability of
        game developer made <strong>Mod Tools</strong> which to my young mind allow you to build a completely new
        game
        on an
        existing engine. This is what led me to fall in love with the challenge of software development. Who says
        video
        games
        aren't good for kids?</p> <br>

    <h1>College Years - University of Cincinnati</h1> <br>
    <p>
        During high school, I knew that I wanted to do something with computers as a career. I also knew that I wanted
        to go to a school that had great oppurtunities. I ended up choosing to go to the University of Cincinnati and
        entered a five year program in the Information Technology major with the additional co-op experience. The co-op
        experience that I gained during my college years will be instrumental to my career and ultimately affirmed that
        I had chosen the right field. A co-op is where you are still a fulltime student but you alternate between
        working a full semester and going to school a full semester until you graduate. It is one of the best
        professional experiences of my life.
    </p>

    <h1>Other Interests</h1> <br>
    <p>
        As of this writing, 12/01/2018, I have quite a plethora of interests. In regards to computing I have become
        very interested in Blockchain technologies and I expect that I will write a blog about why I am very interested
        in them. <br><br> <br>

        I also have gained interest in microcontrollers such as the Arduino. I have been messing around with various
        project ideas that I want to build and will most likely share my successes and failures on here.

        <br> <br>
        <br>
        I also have been enjoying a few video games as of late such as <strong>Subnautica</strong> and <strong>Kerbal
            Space Program</strong>. Subnautica
        offers a truly terrifying and scientific experience that I get lost in for hours at a time. It is truly one
        of
        the best games I have ever played and I'm not sure I will ever actually complete it due to getting scared
        off
        by Leviathans, anyone who has played knows what I mean. Kerbal Space Program is a
        space simulator with a cartoonish touch. It is also one of the best games I have ever played and it
        recently
        has a mod called, kOS, that allows you to script your flights which I am very interested in.
