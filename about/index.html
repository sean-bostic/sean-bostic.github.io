    <p>I have been a software developer for about 5 years. I attended the University of Cincinnati and received a
        Bachelors Degree in Information Techology with a focus in Application Development.
        </br></br>
        I have a wide variety of hobbies and interests. Anything from computer programming to Olympic weightlifting.
        This website will house information about me and my interests.
        The majority of my interests that I will share on here will be geared toward technology and mainly different
        projects I am working on or am interested in.
        </br></br>
        I also will have a page dedicated to my employment history and resume.
