    <p>
        I am someone who has been fascinated with computers since I was a kid. I've been a software developer for about
        5 years and studied at the Univeristy of Cincinnati. This is my personal website which I occasionally update
        with a
        blog post or project update.</p> <br>

    <p>I always enjoy problem solving and using critical thinking to solve complex problems. I have had the most fun
        doing
        this with the almost limitless power of software. Ever since I was a kid, I always enjoyed working with
        computers. I
        started out with hardware believe it or not and eventually found a career in software development. I built my
        first
        computer from scratch when I was about ten which really was just a shiny new computer case with salvaged parts
        from
        various other machines that I had disassembled. My first <strong>TRUE</strong>Icomputer build was when I was
        about
        12. I quickly began playing various PC games especially the legendary FPS games such as Quake, Counterstrike,
        and
        Medal of Honor. These games had increasing specifications for more powerful hardware and that led me to learn
        more
        about building computers.</p> <br>

    <p>Not only did video games get me into building computers, they ultimately introduced me to code and were the main
        driving force for me to get into software development. One of my favorite things about video games was the
        ability of
        game developer made <strong>Mod Tools</strong> which to my young mind allow you to build a completely new game
        on an
        existing engine. This is what led me to fall in love with the challenge of software development. Who says video
        games
        aren't good for kids?</p> <br>
