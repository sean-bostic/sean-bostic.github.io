	<h1>Hello World, I am Sean Bostic!</h1>
	<IMG SRC="/images/sean2.jpg" ALIGN="left" hspace="5" />
	<p>I have been a software developer for about 5 years. I attended the University of Cincinnati and received a
		Bachelors Degree in Information Techology with a focus in Application Development.
		</br> <br>
		I have a wide variety of hobbies and interests. Anything from computer programming to Olympic weightlifting.
		This website will house information about me and my interests.
		The majority of my interests that I will share on here will be geared toward technology and mainly different
		projects I am working on or am interested in.
