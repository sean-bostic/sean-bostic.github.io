	<h1>Hello World, I am Sean Bostic</h1>
	<p>
		<IMG SRC=”sean2.jpg” ALIGN=”left” />
		I am someone who has been fascinated with computers since I was a kid. I've been a software developer for about
		5 years and studied at the Univeristy of Cincinnati. This is my personal website which I occasionally update with a
		blog post or project update.</p> <br>

	<p>I always enjoy problem solving and using critical thinking to solve complex problems. I have had the most fun doing
		this with the almost limitless power of software. Ever since I was a kid, I always enjoyed working with computers. I
		started out with hardware believe it or not and eventually found a career in software development. I built my first
		computer from scratch when I was about ten which really was just a shiny new computer case with salvaged parts from
		various other machines that I had disassembled. I thoroughly enjoyed building a computer through my young adult years
		and it eventually led me into the software side of computing.</p>
