	<h1>Hello World, I am Sean Bostic!</h1>
	<IMG SRC="/images/sean2.jpg" ALIGN="left" hspace="5" />
	<p>I have been a software developer for about 5 years. I attended the University of Cincinnati and received a
		Bachelors Degree in Information Techology with a focus in Application Development.
		</br> <br>
		I have a wide variety of hobbies and interests. Anything from computer programming to Olympic weightlifting.
		This website will house information about me and my interests.
		The majority of my interests that I will share on here will be geared toward technology and mainly different
		projects I am working on or am interested in.
		<br> <br>

		<br> If you are interested in what I think of certain topics I would suggest checking out my blog. I will have
		lengthy posts about subjects that I find interesting and what I have learned about these topics. Some of those
		include digital asset/blockchain projects such as the XRP Ledger, code related items that I have learned, movie
		reviews, and much more.
		</br> <br>
		Most of my interests spawn of my interest in science. I use science as a very broad term but I really enjoy anything
		that has some level of science, technology, engineering, or mathematical roots. I am a giant space nerd also who
		loves reading/learning about the Space Era. I feel very strongly that the era of humans going up to the moon is some
		of the most interesting and mindblowing progress in technology. <br> <br>

		Oh and my favorite movie of all time is <strong>Forrest Gump</strong>.
