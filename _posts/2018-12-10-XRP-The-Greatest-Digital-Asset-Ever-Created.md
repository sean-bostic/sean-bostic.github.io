Brief Intro of Ripple and XRP
	To start off there needs to be a distinction between Ripple, the software company, and xrp, the cryptocurrency. Ripple is a software company that is making payment software that I am convinced is going to change financial technology. XRP is a digital asset (cryptocurrency) that some of Ripple’s instant settlement software is built upon.  I will provide links lower down in the document but I want to give you my high level understanding first so you can understand my optimism for this digital asset.  Ripple and XRP are used interchangeably but just understand that the company has built their disruptive technology to specifically use the digital asset XRP.

	Ripple currently has three main parts of their software: 

1.	xCurrent – this is a messaging system which does NOT use XRP and is already being used. xCurrent, in my opinion, will replace SWIFT entirely and it handles the messaging side of payments. Using xCurrent has been proven to save about 30% on transactions, completes in minutes, and is much more secure than SWIFT.
2.	xRapid – this is the instant settlement portion of their software and xRapid DOES use XRP. An explanation of how xRapid works is down below but it basically uses the blockchain technology paired with the digital token XRP to settle liquidity. Currently it handles the instant settlement part in about 3 seconds but there is an update to the xRapid network to bump up the settlement to a second. xRapid is what will make XRP extremely valuable.
3.	xVia – xVia is a combination of the xCurrent and xRapid but there is not much info on it.

So if you have made it this far and are interested in investing slightly just remember you are not buying “stock” into Ripple – they didn’t have an IPO yet. You are buying into a digital currency that their software suite utilizes for instant settlement. Just remember xRapid = use of xrp.  I can explain how to snatch up some xrp later on.
SWIFT – the dying giant
	If you do anything with cross border payments you know what SWIFT is. If not, SWIFT is a payment method in the banking industry that handles cross-border payments meaning currency to currency. Now I am not going to say anything good about SWIFT here because I don’t think there is anything good about it. 

SWIFT Problems:
1.	SLOW – it takes 3-5 days minimum to send a crossborder payment through the SWIFT system. That’s ridiculous considering I can stream 4k video from the space station but I can’t send someone money like I can send an email?
2.	COSTLY – In order for SWIFT to operate currently it needs to have $25 trillion dollars sitting dormant globally in special bank accounts called NOSTRO/VOSTRO accounts. That $25 trillion dollars does nothing but run this SWIFT system. Basically SWIFT moves around money in these accounts which sometimes means your transaction can flow through multiple banks around the world which also cause the slowness.
3.	VULNERABLE – SWIFT was created 40 years ago. Telegrams were still being used back then and SWIFT’s interface hasn’t really changed. This gap in technology has made it very easy to exploit/hack and if you search SWIFT bank hacks you will see a boatload of hacks that have happened on the SWIFT network. Literally millions of dollars have been stolen by simply tricking the SWIFT system.
4.	6% error rate – SWIFT boasts a 6% error rate on every transaction. Think about that – 6% error rate on every transaction. That 6% error rate is what makes it so vulenerable.

xCurrent is on the verge of completing wiping out SWIFT which is good for Ripple the company. If banks just use xCurrent they will save 30% on their transaction costs and can settle payments in minutes. I think it is a no brainer that Ripple will overtake SWIFT’s dominance in cross-border payments with xCurrent alone but the thing that I’m invested in is xrp and that needs xRapid to be used. So what would cause xRapid to be used as well in cross-border payments? Well here are a few reasons why.

Why banks will use xRapid?
1.	It would free up that $25 trillion dollars. xCurrent will still require around the same amount of money to operate but it xCurrent is much faster than SWIFT, much safer, and much easier to use than SWIFT. If xRapid is used, xrp acts as liquidity to do instant settlement. 
2.	Instant settlement – xRapid will do instant settlement in just over 3 seconds with updates to the network showing that 1 sec will be possible in the future.
3.	Banks will save an additional 30% on transactions which when talking about millions of dollars per transaction makes it seem worth it.
4.	It cannot be hacked. Since xRapid uses blockchain technology usually called a distributed ledger – transactions cannot be faked or hacked in any way.
5.	So banks will have a faster means to settle any payment in any other currency instantly and at a far cheaper rate.

So I think Ripple is going to take over SWIFT’s market and eventually xRapid will be used to save banks 40-70% on transactions and create a platform for instant settlement.  I think it is a matter of time and if xRapid is utilized the price of an xrp token will skyrocket from sheer use and volume alone. Understand that is just ONE of way xRapid can be used and it is the biggest one. There are a ton of other use cases for xRapid that I can talk about another time but this is the one that can really drive the price up.

Current ongoing pilots testing out xRapid
As of now, money remittance companies are realizing how huge of savings they will get if they use xRapid. That being said, Western Union and Moneygram are currently piloting xRapid and will most likely go live this year or next. That volume will drive the price of xrp up but not as drastically as taking over the SWIFT market.
