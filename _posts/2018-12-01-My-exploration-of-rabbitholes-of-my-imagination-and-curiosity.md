I would say I am a person who is very much driven by my curiosity and imagination. When something interests me, I become very intellectually curious about how it works and everything that makes it work. Arguably the biggest interest of mine that has captured my curiosity is computers.

To start, I can't even count how many computers I have over the years. My initial interest spawned from me just wanting to play Video Games. You see my parents refused to get me a video game console such as the Nintendo 64 because I feel like they knew I would never stop playing it after they saw me continually play Pacman for about 4 hours one time. That being said, my family had an old Hewlett-Packard that I soon realized had the ability to play MS-DOS games. This eventually led to me commandeering the PC and learning how to use it far better than my parents. Fast forward to using the internet and my young mind expanded to dimensions that I never could have dreamed of...the amount of information was suddenly at my fingertips...
